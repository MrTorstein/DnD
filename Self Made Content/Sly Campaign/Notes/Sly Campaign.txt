		Bankowner scared for his bank to be robbed and has asked the police to look after the place. He is rich and snobbish, with a large mustach and a nice suit.

Locations:
	- Cooper hideout
		Safehouse used to plan operation
	- Bank
		Four floors and 2 other areas: U2 - Sewers, U1 - vault, E1 - entreance, E2 - offices, E3 - hangout and office of Jessie James, E4 - Roof
		- U2: Filled with water, but lead to a U1 or E1 through grates. Murray is to large to fit through here, Bently is a vegitable and his chair is unpractical to bring in here.
		- U1: Steps down from E1, long hall with a buff guard patrolling and a giant steel door into the vault. The door has a code lock found in E3 in a picture, and a 4th level alarm spell on it which 
			  needs to be dispelled. The vault is large with drawers filled with gold bars. There is also a small wooden cart to move gold there.
		- Outside: Here there are people coming and going, and a large entrence to the bank. There are two guards at the entrence who makes sure weapons aren't brought into the bank. At the sides and
				   back of the building there are windows and holes in the wall, letting Sly scale the building, using about 12 min if passing DC 15 Dex check. The walls are 30 meters high. There is a
				   single buff guard patrolling the building, walking around the building in 30 min.
		- E1: The main hall of the bank and also the normal entrence for customers. A large hall with a long desk area stretching across the whole room except for three gates, one at each wall and one 
		      in the midle of the room. There are employees working for the bank an queue in front of each desk. There are INTERPOL in each corner of the room and a guard at each side of both entrences.
			  At the back of the room there is two stairs, one leading up to E2 and one down to U1.
		- E2: Long hall with lots of offices where people work. There are also two minions, one buff and one melee, patrolling. Most of these work with banking but some also help whitewash money and if
			  looking through these offices it is possible to find evidence of the robberies where most of the banks money come from. Carmelita can be found in one of these offices talking with two of her
			  INTERPOL employees. She will patrol E2 and E1 every hour in real life time. This takes about 5 min. There is also a set of stairs up to next floor and a cupboard.
		- E3: HQ of Jessie James, Carmelita is not allowed here. The floor is a short corridor to a locked door with a guard standing in front of it. This door can be picked open(DC20), and inside is an
			  empty office of Jessie. There is a large landscape painting on one of the walls with a code in it. There is also a desk with incriminating paper, a cupboard with spirits and a few bookshelf
			  with lots of books. A large carpet on the floor. In the roof there is a large window, leading to the roof. Jessie visits for 10 min every real life even number half hour(f.ex. 14:30 or
			  02:30).
		- E4: Window into Jessie's office and four ranged guards patrolling.

		- Visit Tavern
			- Meet someone who works on in the bank, giving them an incomplete map of the bank and that there is a code to the vault which only Jessie and one other person knows

			- This is where the guards hang, letting the gang both check out the potential guards (perhaps fight them in a brawl) and if done correctly reduce the potential amout of guards.
			That could be done either by suggesting a strike or bulling enough guards. Or perhaps beating up enough in a brawl.
			They can also observe the guards uniforms to potentialy make replicas of these uniforms.
		- Library
			Here they can get the floor plans of any building in the city.

language of the worlds less honest population, you find a building marked with what you know is the sign of the black market. Sneaking inside you follow a set of stairs down to a dark room with three
counters and three people. One of them, a woman, greets you:

Going to the Bank in the day:
You walk to the bank near the south western entrence of the city and find yourself in a large square. Most of the open square is taken up by the bank, a large stone building with marble stairs leading
up to a two giant wooden doors. Stone pilars decorate the front and hold a roof over the entrence, and the back of the building almost joins with the much lower houses beihind it to create a backalley.
People are walking up and down the square, some visiting the bank, others simply passing through. While you stand there, you see a weasel dressed in a black suite with white vertical stipes come out of
the bank and walk towards the eastern exit of the square. You recognice this person as Jessie James, the owner of the bank.(Hook to follow him)
Walking to the entrence you see two guards(one buff, one melee) at the entrence of the bank taking care of weaponry. There is also a single buff guard patrolling around the outside of the bank.
Inside the main hall you see a large room with a long desk streaching from one side to the other, split by three gates, one on each wall and a double gate in the middel. There are four lines of people
and four employees behind the desk taking care of the customers in each line. At the back of the room there is a set of stairs leading up and down to other floors. There are five bank guards, on each
side of the entrences(two buff, two ranged, one melee), and four police officers, one in each corner.


Going to the Bank at night:
You sneak to the bank near the south western entrence of the city and find yourself in a large square. Most of the open square is taken up by the bank, a large stone building with marble stairs leading
up to a two giant wooden doors. Stone pilars decorate the front and hold a roof over the entrence, and the back of the building almost joins with the much lower houses beihind it to create a backalley.
The square is almost empty of people and darknes obscures most of it except the front of the bank and some of the houses along the edges. These are lit by a torches hanging on the walls.
Walking to the entrence you see two guards(one buff, one melee) at the entrence of the bank. One is almost sleeping and the other is looking bored. There is also a single buff guard patrolling around
the outside of the bank. You are not allowed to go inside.


Going to the Tavern:
The Tavern is located in the marked. Lots of people at all hours of the day. Mostly the guards and other employees working at the bank, some even wearing their uniforms. There is one scared guy in the 
corner alone, who can be intimidated or charmed into telling them a rough scetch of the bank and also that the police has been contacted. He also knows there is an alarm in the vault, and a code lock on 
the door. Other then this, the gang can reduce the number of guard who will appear in the bank if they start a brawl and beat up 10 or more guys in a fight. This will remove 1 person from each floor of 
the bank and Jessie's call for backup will fail the first time.


Going to the Temple:
There are many different people walking around the park. Some are coming and going to and from the temple, but others are having a picnic in the grass. Inside there are lots of religious workers for all
matters of different religions. Statues of all kinds of gods and dieties line the walls with groups of people praying or kneeling in front of them.


Going to the Library:
An old stone building with a glass and iron dome on the roof of building. No people are here, but going inside you can find a very nice librarian monkey person who can help you find whatever you need.
Particularly the floorplans of the bank. When going here the first or second day, you will pass a group of Gorilla guards going from door to door and asking citizens if they can check their house for
suspicious thieves. On the second day the guards will be seen around the temple, while on the first day they are up at the library. This hints at the guards checking the town from north to south, checking
for thieves.


Going to the Market:
Here you can buy food, weapons, potions and herbs. You can also buy horses and go to a circus. This is also where the tavern is located. Mostly the same things as in the black market, just 10% more 
expensive and no illigal products like black powder and poisons.


Going to the Castle:
There are guards in front of the castle walls blocking the way. This place is out of bounds for anyone at the moment, as a result of rumours of a notorious gang of thieves having come to the town. Anyone
who ask the guards about any information will be told to talk to the police in the barracks.


Going to the Barraks:
The "Police station" where Carmelita hangs out in the day. If you climb up the side to a window you can overhear a conversation between Carmelita and a Gorilla about where there are staged guards at night.
