\textbf{Range:} Self \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S \\
\textbf{Duration:} 1 hour \\
You make yourself - including your clothing, armour, weapons, and other belongings on your person - look different until the spell ends or until you use your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you. The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in mid-air. To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.

		\subsection{False Life}

\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} Self \\

If it is a magic item or some other magic-imbued object, you learn its properties and how to use them, whether it requires attunement to use, and how many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any spells are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created by a spell, you learn which spell created it. If you instead touch a creature throughout the casting, you learn what spells, if any, are currently affecting it.
	
		\subsection{Jump}

1st-level abjuration \\

\textbf{Range:} Touch \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S, M (30 feet of cord or rope, which is consumed by the spell) \\

The trap triggers when a Small creature or larger moves into the area protected by the spell. The triggering creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone and be hoisted into the air until it hangs upside down 3 feet above the protected surface, where it is restrained. \\
The restrained creature can make a Dexterity saving throw with disadvantage at the end of each of its turns and ends the restrained effect on a success. Alternatively, another creature that can reach the restrained creature can use an action to make an Intelligence (Arcana) check against your spell save DC. On a success, the restrained effect also ends.

\textbf{Aquatic Adaptation:} You adapt your body to an aquatic environment, sprouting gills and growing webbing between your fingers. You can breathe underwater and gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed. \\
\textbf{Change Appearance:} You transform your appearance. You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, colouration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your statistics change. You also can't appear as a creature of a different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same; if you're bipedal, you can't use this spell to become quadrupedal, for instance. At any time for the duration of the spell, you can use your action to change your appearance in this way again. \\

Casting Knock on the object suppresses arcane lock for 10 minutes. While affected by this spell, the object is more difficult to break or force open; the DC to break it or pick any locks on it increases by 10.
	
		\subsection{Blur}
2nd-level illusion \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} Self \\
\textbf{Components:} V \\

\textbf{Duration:} Concentration, up to 1 hour \\
You touch a creature and bestow upon it a magical enhancement. Choose one of the following effects; the target gains the effect until the spell ends. \\
\textbf{Bear's Endurance.} The target has advantage on Constitution checks. It also gains 2d6 temporary hit points, which are lost when the spell ends. \\
\textbf{Bull's Strength.} The target has advantage on Strength checks, and their carrying capacity doubles. \\
\textbf{Cat's Grace.} The target has advantage on Dexterity checks. It also doesn't take damage from falling 20 feet or less if it isn't incapacitated. \\

\textbf{Duration:} Concentration, up to 1 minute \\
You cause a creature or an object you can see within range to grow larger or smaller for the duration. Choose either a creature or an object that is neither worn nor carried. If the target is unwilling, it can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell has no effect. \\
If the target is a creature, everything it is wearing and carrying changes size with it. Any item dropped by an affected creature returns to normal size at once. \\
\textbf{Enlarge.} The target's size doubles in all dimensions, and its weight is multiplied by eight. This growth increases its size by one category - from Medium to Large, for example. If there isn't enough room for the target to double its size, the creature or object attains the maximum possible size in the space available. Until the spell ends, the target also has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target's weapons also grow to match its new size. While these weapons are enlarged, the target's attacks with them deal 1d4 extra damage. \\
\textbf{Reduce.} The target's size is halved in all dimensions, and its weight is reduced to one-eighth of normal. This reduction decreases its size by one category - from Medium to Small, for example. Until the spell ends, the target also has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target's weapons also shrink to match its new size. While these weapons are reduced, the target's attacks with them deal 1d4 less damage (this can't reduce the damage below 1).
	
		\subsection{Heat Metal}
2nd-level transmutation \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} 60 feet \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S, M (a piece of iron and a flame) \\
\textbf{Duration:} Concentration, up to 1 minute \\
Choose a manufactured metal object, such as a metal weapon or a suit of heavy or medium metal armour, that you can see within range. You cause the object to glow red-hot. Any creature in physical contact with the object takes 2d8 fire damage when you cast the spell. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns to cause this damage again. \\
If a creature is holding or wearing the object and takes the damage from it, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or drop the object if it can. If it doesn't drop the object, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of your next turn. \\
\textbf{At Higher Levels.} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

		\subsection{Invisibility}

\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} Touch \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S, M (an eyelash encased in gum arabic) \\
\textbf{Duration:} Concentration, up to 1 hour \\
A creature you touch becomes invisible until the spell ends. Anything the target is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on the target's person. The spell ends for a target that attacks or casts a spell. \\
\textbf{At Higher Levels.} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.
	
		\subsection{Lesser Restoration}
2nd-level abjuration \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} Touch \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S \\

\textbf{Duration:} Concentration, up to 10 minutes \\
One creature or object of your choice that you can see within range rises vertically, up to 20 feet, and remains suspended there for the duration. The spell can levitate a target that weighs up to 500 pounds. An unwilling creature that succeeds on a Constitution saving throw is unaffected. \\
The target can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing. You can change the target's altitude by up to 20 feet in either direction on your turn. If you are the target, you can move up or down as part of your move. Otherwise, you can use your action to move the target, which must remain within the spell's range. \\
When the spell ends, the target floats gently to the ground if it is still aloft.
	
		\subsection{Magic Weapon}
2nd-level transmutation \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 bonus action \\
\textbf{Range:} Touch \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S \\
\textbf{Duration:} Concentration, up to 1 hour \\
You touch a non-magical weapon. Until the spell ends, that weapon becomes a magic weapon with a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls. \\

		\subsection{Protection from Poison}
2nd-level abjuration \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} Touch \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S \\

		\subsection{Rope Trick}
2nd-level transmutation \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} Touch \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S, M (powdered corn extract and a twisted loop of parchment) \\
\textbf{Duration:} 1 hour \\
You touch a length of rope that is up to 60 feet long. One end of the rope then rises into the air until the whole rope hangs perpendicular to the ground. At the upper end of the rope, an invisible entrance opens to an extradimensional space that lasts until the spell ends. \\
The extradimensional space can be reached by climbing to the top of the rope. The space can hold as many as eight Medium or smaller creatures. The rope can be pulled into the space, making the rope disappear from view outside the space. \\
Attacks and spells can't cross through the entrance into or out of the extradimensional space, but those inside can see out of it as if through a 3-foot-by-5-foot window centered on the rope. \\
Anything inside the extradimensional space drops out when the spell ends.

		\subsection{See Invisibility}

Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch gains the ability to move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving its hands free. The target also gains a climbing speed equal to its walking speed.



	\section{3rd Level Spells}
		\subsection{Blink}
3rd-level transmutation \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} Self \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S \\
\textbf{Duration:} 1 minute \\
Roll a d20 at the end of each of your turns for the duration of the spell. On a roll of 11 or higher, you vanish from your current plane of existence and appear in the Ethereal Plane (the spell fails and the casting is wasted if you were already on that plane). At the start of your next turn, and when the spell ends if you are on the Ethereal Plane, you return to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of the space you vanished from. If no unoccupied space is available within that range, you appear in the nearest unoccupied space (chosen at random if more than one space is equally near). You can dismiss this spell as an action. \\
While on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and hear the plane you originated from, which is cast in shades of gray, and you can't see anything there more than 60 feet away. You can only affect and be affected by other creatures on the Ethereal Plane. Creatures that aren't there can't perceive you or interact with you, unless they have the ability to do so.
	
		\subsection{Catnap}
3rd-level Enchantment \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} 30 feet \\
\textbf{Components:} S, M (a pinch of sand) \\
\textbf{Duration:} 10 minutes \\
You make a calming gesture, and up to three willing creatures of your choice that you can see within range fall unconscious for the spell's duration. The spell ends on a target early if it takes damage or someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake. If a target remains unconscious for the full duration, that target gains the benefit of a short rest, and it can't be affected by this spell again until it finishes a long rest. \\
\textbf{At Higher Levels:} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional willing creature for each slot level above 3rd.

		\subsection{Fly}
3rd-level transmutation \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} Touch \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S, M (a wing feather from any bird) \\
\textbf{Duration:} Concentration, up to 10 minutes \\
You touch a willing creature. The target gains a flying speed of 60 feet for the duration. When the spell ends, the target falls if it is still aloft, unless it can stop the fall. \\
\textbf{At Higher Levels.} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.
	
		\subsection{Gaseous Form}
3rd-level transmutation \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} Touch \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S, M (a bit of gauze and a wisp of smoke) \\
\textbf{Duration:} Concentration, up to 1 hour \\
You transform a willing creature you touch, along with everything it's wearing and carrying, into a misty cloud for the duration. The spell ends if the creature drops to 0 hit points. An incorporeal creature isn't affected. \\
While in this form, the target's only method of movement is a flying speed of 10 feet. The target can enter and occupy the space of another creature. The target has resistance to non-magical damage, and it has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. The target can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and even mere cracks, though it treats liquids as though they were solid surfaces. The target can't fall and remains hovering in the air even when stunned or otherwise incapacitated. \\
While in the form of a misty cloud, the target can't talk or manipulate objects, and any objects it was carrying or holding can't be dropped, used, or otherwise interacted with. The target can't attack or cast spells.
	
		\subsection{Glyph of Warding}
3rd-level abjuration \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 hour \\
\textbf{Range:} Touch \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S, M (incense and powdered diamond worth at least 200 gp, which the spell consumes) \\
\textbf{Duration:} Until dispelled or triggered \\
When you cast this spell, you inscribe a glyph that harms other creatures, either upon a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph. If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered. \\
The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found. \\
You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends. \\
You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password. \\
When you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a spell glyph. \\
\textbf{Explosive Runes.} When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one. \\
\textbf{Spell Glyph.} You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration. \\
\textbf{At Higher Levels.} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an explosive runes glyph increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd. If you create a spell glyph, you can store any spell of up to the same level as the slot you use for the glyph of warding.

		\subsection{Haste}
3rd-level transmutation \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} 30 feet \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S, M (a shaving of licorice root) \\
\textbf{Duration:} Concentration, up to 1 minute \\
Choose a willing creature that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, the target's speed is doubled, it gains a +2 bonus to AC, it has advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and it gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. \\
When the spell ends, the target can't move or take actions until after its next turn, as a wave of lethargy sweeps over it.
	
		\subsection{Protection from Energy}
3rd-level abjuration \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} Touch \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S \\
\textbf{Duration:} Concentration, up to 1 hour \\
For the duration, the willing creature you touch has resistance to one damage type of your choice: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.
	
		\subsection{Revivify}
3rd-level necromancy \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} Touch \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S, M (diamonds worth 300 gp, which the spell consumes) \\
\textbf{Duration:} Instantaneous \\
You touch a creature that has died within the last minute. That creature returns to life with 1 hit point. This spell can't return to life a creature that has died of old age, nor can it restore any missing body parts.

		\subsection{Water Breathing}
3rd-level transmutation (ritual) \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} 30 feet \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S, M (a short reed or piece of straw) \\
\textbf{Duration:} 24 hours \\
This spell grants up to ten willing creatures you can see within range the ability to breathe underwater until the spell ends. Affected creatures also retain their normal mode of respiration.

		\subsection{Water Walk}
3rd-level transmutation (ritual) \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} 30 feet \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S, M (a piece of cork) \\
\textbf{Duration:} 1 hour \\
This spell grants the ability to move across any liquid surface - such as water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand, or lava - as if it were harmless solid ground (creatures crossing molten lava can still take damage from the heat). Up to ten willing creatures you can see within range gain this ability for the duration. \\
If you target a creature submerged in a liquid, the spell carries the target to the surface of the liquid at a rate of 60 feet per round.



	\section{4th Level Spells}
		\subsection{Arcane Eye}
4th-level divination \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} 30 feet \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S, M (a bit of bat fur) \\
\textbf{Duration:} Concentration, up to 1 hour \\
You create an invisible, magical eye within range that hovers in the air for the duration. \\
You mentally receive visual information from the eye, which has normal vision and Darkvision out to 30 feet. The eye can look in every direction. As an action, you can move the eye up to 30 feet in any direction. \\
There is no limit to how far away from you the eye can move, but it can't enter another plane of existence. A solid barrier blocks the eye's movement, but the eye can pass through an opening as small as 1 inch in diameter.
	
		\subsection{Death Ward}
4th-level abjuration \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} Touch \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S \\
\textbf{Duration:} 8 hours \\
You touch a creature and grant it a measure of protection from death. The first time the target would drop to 0 hit points as a result of taking damage, the target instead drops to 1 hit point, and the spell ends. If the spell is still in effect when the target is subjected to an effect that would kill it instantaneously without dealing damage, that effect is instead negated against the target, and the spells ends.
	
		\subsection{Fabricate}
4th-level transmutation \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 10 minutes \\
\textbf{Range:} 120 feet \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S \\
\textbf{Duration:} Instantaneous \\
You convert raw materials into products of the same material. For example, you can fabricate a wooden bridge from a clump of trees, a rope from a patch of hemp, and clothes from flax or wool. \\
Choose raw materials that you can see within range. You can fabricate a Large or smaller object (contained within a 10-foot cube, or eight connected 5-foot cubes), given a sufficient quantity of raw material. If you are working with metal, stone, or another mineral substance, however, the fabricated object can be no larger than Medium (contained within a single 5-foot cube). The quality of objects made by the spell is commensurate with the quality of the raw materials. \\
Creatures or magic items can't be created or transmuted by this spell. You also can't use it to create items that ordinarily require a high degree of craftsmanship, such as jewelry, weapons, glass, or armor, unless you have proficiency with the type of artisan's tools used to craft such objects.

		\subsection{Freedom of Movement}
4th-level abjuration \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} Touch \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S, M (a leather strap, bound around the arm or a similar appendage) \\
\textbf{Duration:} 1 hour \\
You touch a willing creature. For the duration, the target's movement is unaffected by difficult terrain, and spells and other magical effects can neither reduce the target's speed nor cause the target to be paralysed or restrained. \\
The target can also spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape from nonmagical restraints, such as manacles or a creature that has it grappled. Finally, being underwater imposes no penalties on the target's movement or attacks.
	
		\subsection{Leomund's Secret Chest}
4th-level conjuration \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} Touch \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S, M (an exquisite chest, 3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet, constructed from rare materials worth at least 5000 gp, and a tiny replica made from the same materials worth at least 50 gp) \\
\textbf{Duration:} Instantaneous \\
You hide a chest, and all its contents, on the Ethereal Plane. You must touch the chest and the miniature replica that serves as a material component for the spell. The chest can contain up to 12 cubic feet of non-living material (3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet). \\
While the chest remains on the Ethereal Plane, you can use an action and touch the replica to recall the chest. It appears in an unoccupied space on the ground within 5 feet of you. You can send the chest back to the Ethereal Plane by using an action and touching both the chest and the replica. \\
After 60 days, there is a cumulative 5 percent chance per day that the spell's effect ends. This effect ends if you cast this spell again, if the smaller replica chest is destroyed, or if you choose to end the spell as an action. If the spell ends and the larger chest is on the Ethereal Plane, it is irretrievably lost.
	
		\subsection{Mordenkainen's Faithful Hound}
4th-level conjuration \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} 30 feet \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S, M (a tiny silver whistle, a piece of bone, and a thread) \\
\textbf{Duration:} 8 hours \\
You conjure a phantom watchdog in an unoccupied space that you can see within range, where it remains for the duration, until you dismiss it as an action, or until you move more than 100 feet away from it. \\
The hound is invisible to all creatures except you and can't be harmed. When a small or larger creature comes within 30 feet of it without first speaking the password that you specify when you cast this spell, the hound starts barking loudly. The hound sees invisible creatures and can see into the Ethereal Plane. It ignores illusions. \\
At the start of each of your turns, the hound attempts to bite one creature within 5 feet of it that is hostile to you. The hound's attack bonus is equal to your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus. On a hit, it deals 4d8 piercing damage.
	
		\subsection{Mordenkainen's Private Sanctum}
4th-level abjuration \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 10 minutes \\
\textbf{Range:} 120 feet \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S, M (a thin sheet of lead, a piece of opaque glass, a wad of cotton or cloth, and powdered chrysolite) \\
\textbf{Duration:} 24 hours \\
You make an area within range magically secure. The area is a cube that can be as small as 5 feet to as large as 100 feet on each side. The spell lasts for the duration or until you use an action to dismiss it. \\
When you cast the spell, you decide what sort of security the spell provides, choosing any or all of the following properties: \\
$\bullet$ Sound can't pass through the barrier at the edge of the warded area. \\
$\bullet$ The barrier of the warded area appears dark and foggy, preventing vision (including Darkvision) through it. \\
$\bullet$ Sensors created by divination spells can't appear inside the protected area or pass through the barrier at its perimeter. \\
$\bullet$ Creatures in the area can't be targeted by divination spells. \\
$\bullet$ Nothing can teleport into or out of the warded area. \\
$\bullet$ Planar travel is blocked within the warded area. \\
Casting this spell on the same spot every day for a year makes this effect permanent. \\
\textbf{At Higher Levels.} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can increase the size of the cube by 100 feet for each slot level beyond 4th. Thus you could protect a cube that can be up to 200 feet on one side by using a spell slot of 5th level.

		\subsection{Otiluke's Resilient Sphere}
4th-level evocation \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} 30 feet \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S, M (a hemispherical piece of clear crystal and a matching hemispherical piece of gum arabic) \\
\textbf{Duration:} Concentration, up to 1 minute \\
A sphere of shimmering force encloses a creature or object of large size or smaller within range. An unwilling creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is enclosed for the duration. \\
Nothing - not physical objects, energy, or other spell effects - can pass through the barrier, in or out, though a creature in the sphere can breathe there. The sphere is immune to all damage, and a creature or object inside can't be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the sphere damage anything outside it. \\
The sphere is weightless and just large enough to contain the creature or object inside. An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere's walls and thus roll the sphere at up to half the creature's speed. Similarly, the globe can be picked up and moved by other creatures. \\
A disintegrate spell targeting the globe destroys it without harming anything inside it.

		\subsection{Stone Shape}
4th-level transmutation \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} Touch \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S, M (soft clay, which must be worked into roughly the desired shape of the stone object) \\
\textbf{Duration:} Instantaneous \\
You touch a stone object of Medium size or smaller or a section of stone no more than 5 feet in any dimension and form it into any shape that suits your purpose. So, for example, you could shape a large rock into a weapon, idol, or coffer, or make a small passage through a wall, as long as the wall is less than 5 feet thick. You could also shape a stone door or its frame to seal the door shut. The object you create can have up to two hinges and a latch, but finer mechanical detail isn't possible.
	
		\subsection{Stoneskin}
4th-level abjuration \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} Touch \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S, M (diamond dust worth 100 gp, which the spell consumes) \\
\textbf{Duration:} Concentration, up to 1 hour \\
This spell turns the flesh of a willing creature you touch as hard as stone. Until the spell ends, the target has resistance to non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.



	\section{5th Level Spells}
		\subsection{Animate Objects}
5th-level transmutation \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} 120 feet \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S \\
\textbf{Duration:} Concentration, up to 1 minute \\
Objects come to life at your command. Choose up to ten non-magical objects within range that are not being worn or carried. Medium targets count as two objects, Large targets count as four objects, Huge targets count as eight objects. You can't animate any object larger than Huge. Each target animates and becomes a creature under your control until the spell ends or until reduced to 0 hit points. \\
As a bonus action, you can mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 500 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete. \\
\\
\textbf{Animated Object Statistics} \\
			\begin{tabular}{lcclcc}
\textbf{Size} & \textbf{HP} & \textbf{AC} & \textbf{Attack} & \textbf{Str} & \textbf{Dex} \\
Tiny & 20 & 18 & +8 to hit, 1d4 + 4 damage & 4 & 18 \\
Small & 25 & 16 & +6 to hit, 1d8 + 2 damage & 6 & 14 \\
Medium & 40 & 13 & +5 to hit, 2d6 + 1 damage & 10 & 12 \\
Large & 50 & 10 & +6 to hit, 2d10 + 2 damage & 14 & 10 \\
Huge & 80 & 10 & +8 to hit, 2d12 + 4 damage & 18 & 6 \\
			\end{tabular} \\
An animated object is a construct with AC, hit points, attacks, Strength, and Dexterity determined by its size. Its Constitution is 10 and its Intelligence and Wisdom are 3, and its Charisma is 1. Its speed is 30 feet; if the object lacks legs or other appendages it can use for locomotion, it instead has a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover. If the object is securely attached to a surface or a larger object, such as a chain bolted to a wall, its speed is 0. It has Blindsight with a radius of 30 feet and is blind beyond that distance. When the animated object drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original object form, and any remaining damage carries over to its original object form. \\
If you command an object to attack, it can make a single melee attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. It makes a slam attack with an attack bonus and bludgeoning damage determined by its size. The DM might rule that a specific object inflicts slashing or piercing damage based on its form. \\
\textbf{At Higher Levels.} If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can animate two additional objects for each slot level above 5th.
	
		\subsection{Bigby's Hand}
5th-level evocation \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} 120 feet \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S, M (an eggshell and a snakeskin glove) \\
\textbf{Duration:} Concentration, up to 1 minute \\
You create a Large hand of shimmering, translucent force in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The hand lasts for the spell's duration, and it moves at your command, mimicking the movements of your own hand. \\
The hand is an object that has AC 20 and hit points equal to your hit point maximum. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends. It has a Strength of 26 (+8) and a Dexterity of 10 (+0). The hand doesn't fill its space. \\
When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns, you can move the hand up to 60 feet and then cause one of the following effects with it. \\
\textbf{Clenched Fist.} The hand strikes one creature or object within 5 feet of it. Make a melee spell attack for the hand using your game statistics. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 force damage. \\
\textbf{Forceful Hand.} The hand attempts to push a creature within 5 feet of it in a direction you choose. Make a check with the hand's Strength contested by the Strength (Athletics) check of the target. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. If you succeed, the hand pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting ability modifier. The hand moves with the target to remain within 5 feet of it. \\
\textbf{Grasping Hand.} The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. You use the hand's Strength score to resolve the grapple. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. While the hand is grappling the target, you can use a bonus action to have the hand crush it. When you do so, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier. \\
\textbf{Interposing Hand.} The hand interposes itself between you and a creature you choose until you give the hand a different command. The hand moves to stay between you and the target, providing you with half cover against the target. The target can't move through the hand's space if its Strength score is less than or equal to the hand’s Strength score. If its Strength score is higher than the hand's Strength score, the target can move toward you through the hand's space, but that space is difficult terrain for the target. \\
\textbf{At Higher Levels.} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage from the clenched fist option increases by 2d8 and the damage from the grasping hand increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 5th.

		\subsection{Creation}
5th-level illusion \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 minute \\
\textbf{Range:} 30 feet \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S, M (a tiny piece of matter of the same type of the item you plan to create) \\
\textbf{Duration:} Special \\
You pull wisps of shadow material from the Shadowfell to create a non-living object of vegetable matter within range: soft goods, rope, wood, or something similar. You can also use this spell to create mineral objects such as stone, crystal, or metal. The object created must be no larger than a 5-foot cube, and the object must be of a form and material that you have seen before. The duration depends on the object's material. If the object is composed of multiple materials, use the shortest duration. \\
			\begin{tabular}{ll}
\textbf{Material} & \textbf{Duration} \\
Vegetable matter & 1 day \\
Stone or crystal & 12 hours \\
Precious metals & 1 hour \\
Gems & 10 minutes \\
Adamantine or mithral & 1 minute
			\end{tabular} \\
Using any material created by this spell as another spell's material component causes that spell to fail. \\
\textbf{At Higher Levels.} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the cube increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 5th.
	
		\subsection{Greater Restoration}
5th-level abjuration \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} Touch \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S, M (diamond dust worth at least 100 gp, which the spell consumes) \\
\textbf{Duration:} Instantaneous \\
You imbue a creature you touch with positive energy to undo a debilitating effect. You can reduce the target's exhaustion level by one, or end one of the following effects on the target: \\
$\bullet$ One effect that charmed or petrified the target \\
$\bullet$ One curse, including the target's attunement to a cursed magic item \\
$\bullet$ Any reduction to one of the target's ability scores \\
$\bullet$ One effect reducing the target's hit point maximum

		\subsection{Wall of Stone}
5th-level evocation \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} 120 feet \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S, M (a small block of granite) \\
\textbf{Duration:} Concentration, up to 10 minutes \\
A non-magical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with at least one other panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick. \\
If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall. \\
The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can't occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn't need to be vertical or rest on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp. \\
If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on. \\
The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the DM's discretion. \\
If you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can't be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the spell ends.

\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} 60 feet \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S \\
\textbf{Duration:} Instantaneous \\
A ray of sickening greenish energy lashes out toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 poison damage and must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is also poisoned until the end of your next turn. \\

\textbf{Range:} 60 feet \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S, M (a bit of tallow, a pinch of brimstone, and a dusting of powdered iron) \\
\textbf{Duration:} Concentration, up to 1 minute \\
A 5-foot-diameter sphere of fire appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within range and lasts for the duration. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. \\
As a bonus action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet. If you ram the sphere into a creature, that creature must make the saving throw against the sphere’s damage, and the sphere stops moving this turn. \\
When you move the sphere, you can direct it over barriers up to 5 feet tall and jump it across pits up to 10 feet wide. The sphere ignites flammable objects not being worn or carried, and it sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. \\
\textbf{At Higher Levels.} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.

\textbf{Components:} V, S, M (powdered rhubarb leaf and an adder’s stomach) \\
\textbf{Duration:} Instantaneous \\
A shimmering green arrow streaks toward a target within range and bursts in a spray of acid. Make a ranged spell attack against the target.

\textbf{At Higher Levels.} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage (both initial and later) increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 2nd.

		\subsection{Gaseous Form}
3rd-level transmutation \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} Touch \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S, M (a bit of gauze and a wisp of smoke) \\
\textbf{Duration:} Concentration, up to 1 hour \\
You transform a willing creature you touch, along with everything it's wearing and carrying, into a misty cloud for the duration. The spell ends if the creature drops to 0 hit points. An incorporeal creature isn't affected. \\
While in this form, the target's only method of movement is a flying speed of 10 feet. The target can enter and occupy the space of another creature. The target has resistance to nonmagical damage, and it has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. The target can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and even mere cracks, though it treats liquids as though they were solid surfaces. The target can't fall and remains hovering in the air even when stunned or otherwise incapacitated. \\
While in the form of a misty cloud, the target can't talk or manipulate objects, and any objects it was carrying or holding can't be dropped, used, or otherwise interacted with. The target can't attack or cast spells.

		\subsection{Mass Healing Words}
3rd-level evocation \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 bonus action \\
\textbf{Range:} 60 feet \\
\textbf{Components:} V \\
\textbf{Duration:} Instantaneous \\
As you call out words of restoration, up to six creatures of your choice that you can see within range regain hit points equal to 1d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs. \\
\textbf{At Higher Levels.} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the healing increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 3rd.

		\subsection{Blight}
4th-level necromancy \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} 30 feet \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S \\
\textbf{Duration:} Instantaneous \\
Necromantic energy washes over a creature of your choice that you can see within range, draining moisture and vitality from it. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. The target takes 8d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs. \\
If you target a plant creature or a magical plant, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage, and the spell deals maximum damage to it. If you target a nonmagical plant that isn't a creature, such as a tree or shrub, it doesn't make a saving throw; it simply withers and dies. \\
\textbf{At Higher Levels.} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.

		\subsection{Death Ward}
4th-level abjuration \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} Touch \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S \\
\textbf{Duration:} 8 hours \\
You touch a creature and grant it a measure of protection from death. \\
The first time the target would drop to 0 hit points as a result of taking damage, the target instead drops to 1 hit point, and the spell ends. \\
If the spell is still in effect when the target is subjected to an effect that would kill it instantaneously without dealing damage, that effect is instead negated against the target, and the spell ends.

		\subsection{Cloudkill}
5th-level conjuration \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} 120 feet \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S \\
\textbf{Duration:} Concentration, up to 10 minutes \\
You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of poisonous, yellow- green fog centered on a point you choose within range. The fog spreads around corners. It lasts for the duration or until strong wind disperses the fog, ending the spell. Its area is heavily obscured. \\
When a creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 5d8 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures are affected even if they hold their breath or don’t need to breathe. \\
The fog moves 10 feet away from you at the start of each of your turns, rolling along the surface of the ground. The vapors, being heavier than air, sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down openings. \\
\textbf{At Higher Levels.} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.

		\subsection{Raise Dead}
5th-level necromancy \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 hour \\
\textbf{Range:} Touch \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 500 gp, which the spell consumes) \\
\textbf{Duration:} Instantaneous \\
You return a dead creature you touch to life, provided that it has been dead no longer than 10 days. If the creature's soul is both willing and at liberty to rejoin the body, the creature returns to life with 1 hit point. \\
This spell also neutralizes any poisons and cures nonmagical diseases that affected the creature at the time it died. This spell doesn't, however, remove magical diseases, curses, or similar effects; if these aren't first removed prior to casting the spell, they take effect when the creature returns to life. The spell can't return an undead creature to life. \\
This spell closes all mortal wounds, but it doesn't restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its survival - its head, for instance - the spell automatically fails. \\
Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a -4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.
