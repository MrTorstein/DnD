You set an alarm against unwanted intrusion. Choose a door, a window, or an area within range that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. Until the spell ends, an alarm alerts you whenever a Tiny or larger creature touches or enters the warded area. When you cast the spell, you can designate creatures that won’t set off the alarm. You also choose whether the alarm is mental or audible. A mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping. An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell for 10 seconds within 60 feet.

This spell lets you convince a beast that you mean it no harm. Choose a beast that you can see within range. It must see and hear you. If the beast’s Intelligence is 4 or higher, the spell fails. Otherwise, the beast must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the spell’s duration. If you or one of your companions harms the target, the spells ends. \\

\textbf{Range:} Self \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S \\
\textbf{Duration:} Concentration, up to 10 minutes \\
For the duration, you sense the presence of magic within 30 feet of you. If you sense magic in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any. The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1  foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.

1st-level conjuration \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 bonus action \\
\textbf{Range:} Self \\
\textbf{Components:} V \\
\textbf{Duration:} Concentration, up to 1 minute \\
The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack before this spell ends, a writhing mass of thorny vines appears at the point of impact, and the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by the magical vines until the spell ends. A Large or larger creature has advantage on this saving throw. If the target succeeds on the save, the vines shrivel away. \\
While restrained by this spell, the target takes 1d6 piercing damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature restrained by the vines or one that can touch the creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the target is freed. \\
\textbf{At Higher Levels:} If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

\textbf{Range:} 120 feet \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S \\
\textbf{Duration:} Concentration, up to 1 hour \\
You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of fog centred on a point within range. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it. \\

Up to ten berries appear in your hand and are infused with magic for the duration. A creature can use its action to eat one berry. Eating a berry restores 1 hit point, and the berry provides enough nourishment to sustain a creature for one day. \\
The berries lose their potency if they have not been consumed within 24 hours of the casting of this spell.

1st-level conjuration \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 bonus action \\
\textbf{Range:} Self \\
\textbf{Components:} V \\
\textbf{Duration:} Concentration, up to 1 minute \\
The next time you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack before the spell ends, this spell creates a rain of thorns that sprouts from your ranged weapon or ammunition. In addition to the normal effect of the attack, the target of the attack and each creature within 5 feet of it must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 1dlO piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. \\
\textbf{At Higher Levels:} If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 1st (to a maximum of 6d10).

You gain the ability to comprehend and verbally communicate with beasts for the duration. The knowledge and awareness of many beasts is limited by their intelligence, but at minimum, beasts can give you information about nearby locations and monsters, including whatever they can perceive or have perceived within the past day. You might be able to persuade a beast to perform a small favor for you, at the DM ’s discretion.



	\section{2nd Level Spells}
		\subsection{Animal Messenger}
2nd-level enchantment (ritual) \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} 30 feet \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S, M (a morsel of food) \\
\textbf{Duration:} 24 hours \\
By means of this spell, you use an animal to deliver a message. Choose a Tiny beast you can see within range, such as a squirrel, a blue jay, or a bat. You specify a location, which you must have visited, and a recipient who matches a general description, such as “a man or woman dressed in the uniform of the town guard” or “a red-haired dwarf wearing a pointed hat.” You also speak a message of up to twenty-five words. The target beast travels for the duration of the spell toward the specified location, covering about 50 miles per 24 hours for a flying messenger, or 25 miles for other animals. When the messenger arrives, it delivers your message to the creature that you described, replicating the sound of your voice. The messenger speaks only to a creature matching the description you gave. If the messenger doesn’t reach its destination before the spell ends, the message is lost, and the beast makes its way back to where you cast this spell. \\
\textbf{At Higher Levels:} If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3nd level or higher, the duration of the spell increases by 48 hours for each slot level above 2nd.

		\subsection{Barkskin}
2nd-level transmutation \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} Touch \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S, M (a handful of oak bark) \\
\textbf{Duration:} Concentration, up to 1 hour \\
You touch a willing creature. Until the spell ends, the target’s skin has a rough, bark-like appearance, and the target’s AC can't be less than 16, regardless of what kind of armor it is wearing.

		\subsection{Beast Sense}
2nd-level divination (ritual) \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} Touch \\
\textbf{Components:} S \\
\textbf{Duration:} Concentration, up to 1 hour \\
You touch a willing beast. For the duration of the spell, you can use your action to see through the beast’s eyes and hear what it hears, and continue to do so until you use your action to return to your normal senses. While perceiving through the beast’s senses, you gain the benefits of any special senses possessed by that creature, though you are blinded and deafened to your own surroundings.

		\subsection{Cordon of Arrows}
2nd-level transmutation \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} 5 feet \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S, M (four or more arrows or bolts) \\
\textbf{Duration:} 8 hours \\
You plant four pieces of nonmagical ammunition - arrows or crossbow bolts - in the ground within range and lay magic upon them to protect an area. Until the spell ends, whenever a creature other than you comes within 30 feet of the ammunition for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there, one piece of ammunition flies up to strike it. The creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 piercing damage. The piece of ammunition is then destroyed. The spell ends when no ammunition remains. \\
When you cast this spell, you can designate any creatures you choose, and the spell ignores them. \\
\textbf{At Higher Levels:} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the amount of ammunition that can be affected increases by two for each slot level above 2nd.

		\subsection{Darkvision}
2nd-level transmutation \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} Touch \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S, M (either a pinch of dried carrot or an agate) \\
\textbf{Duration:} 8 hours \\
You touch a willing creature to grant it the ability to see in the dark. For the duration, that creature has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.

		\subsection{Detect Thoughts}
2nd-level divination \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} Self \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S, M (a copper piece) \\
\textbf{Duration:} Concentration, up to 1 minute \\
For the duration, you can read the thoughts o f certain creatures. When you cast the spell and as your action on each turn until the spell ends, you can focus your mind on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn’t speak any language, the creature is unaffected. \\
You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature—what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature’s mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends. \\
Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation. \\
You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can’t see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can’t detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn’t speak any language. \\
Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can’t see it, but it must still be within range.

		\subsection{Find Traps}
2nd-level divination \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} 120 feet \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S \\
\textbf{Duration:} Instantaneous \\
You sense the presence of any trap within range that is within line of sight. A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes anything that would inflict a sudden or unexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable, which was specifically intended as such by its creator. Thus, the spell would sense an area affected by the alarm spell, a glyph of warding, or a mechanical pit trap, but it would not reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole. \\
This spell merely reveals that a trap is present. You don’t learn the location of each trap, but you do learn the general nature of the danger posed by a trap you sense.

		\subsection{Lesser Restoration}
2nd-level abjuration \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} Touch \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S \\
\textbf{Duration:} Instantaneous \\
You touch a creature and can end either one disease or one condition afflicting it. The condition can be blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned.

\textbf{Components:} V, S, M (a bit of fur from a bloodhound) \\
\textbf{Duration:} Instantaneous \\
Describe or name a specific kind of beast or plant. Concentrating on the voice of nature in your surroundings, you learn the direction and distance to the closest creature or plant of that kind within 5 miles, if any are present.

		\subsection{Locate Object}
2nd-level divination \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} Self \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S, M (a forked twig) \\
\textbf{Duration:} Concentration, up to 10 minutes \\
Describe or name an object that is familiar to you. You sense the direction to the object’s location, as long as that object is within 1,000 feet of you. If the object is in motion, you know the direction of its movement. \\
The spell can locate a specific object known to you, as long as you have seen it up close—within 30 feet—at least once. Alternatively, the spell can locate the nearest object of a particular kind, such as a certain kind of apparel, jewelry, furniture, tool, or weapon. \\
This spell can’t locate an object if any thickness of lead, even a thin sheet, blocks a direct path between you and the object.

		\subsection{Pass without Trace}
2nd-level abjuration \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} Self \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S, M (ashes from a burned leaf of mistletoe and a sprig of spruce) \\
\textbf{Duration:} Concentration, up to 1 hour \\
A veil of shadows and silence radiates from you, masking you and your companions from detection. For the duration, each creature you choose within 30 feet of you (including you) has a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks and can’t be tracked except by magical means. A creature that receives this bonus leaves behind no tracks or other traces of its passage.

		\subsection{Protection from Poison}
2nd-level abjuration \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} Touch \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S \\
\textbf{Duration:} 1 hour \\
You touch a creature. If it is poisoned, you neutralize the poison. If more than one poison afflicts the target, you neutralize one poison that you know is present, or you neutralize one at random. \\
For the duration, the target has advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and it has resistance to poison damage.

		\subsection{Silence}
2nd-level illusion (ritual) \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} 120 feet \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S \\
\textbf{Duration:} Consentration, up to 10 minutes \\
For the duration, no sound can be created within or pass through a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. Any creature or object entirely inside the sphere is immune to thunder damage, and creatures are deafened while entirely inside it. Casting a spell that includes a verbal component is impossible there.

		\subsection{Spike Growth}
2nd-level transmutation \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} 150 feet \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S, M (seven sharp thorns or seven small twigs, each sharpened to a point) \\
\textbf{Duration:} Concentration, up to 10 minutes \\
The ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range twists and sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels. \\
The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that can’t see the area at the time the spell is cast must make a Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it.



	\section{3rd Level Spells}

\indent $\bullet$ Two beasts of challenge rating 1 or lower \\
\indent $\bullet$ Four beasts of challenge rating 1/2 or lower \\
\indent $\bullet$ Eight beasts of challenge rating 1/4 or lower \\
Each beast is also considered fey, and it disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. \\
The summoned creatures are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned creatures as a group, which has its own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions. \\
The DM has the creatures’ statistics. \\
\textbf{At Higher Levels:} When you cast this spell using certain higher-level spell slots, you choose one of the summoning options above, and more creatures appear: twice as many with a 5th-level slot, three times as many with a 7th-level slot, and four times as many with a 9th-level slot.

		\subsection{Conjure Barrage}
3rd-level conjuration \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} Self (60 foot cone) \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S, M (one piece of ammunition or a thrown weapon) \\
\textbf{Duration:} Instantaneous \\
You throw a nonmagical weapon or fire a piece of nonmagical ammunition into the air to create a cone of identical weapons that shoot forward and then disappear. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The damage type is the same as that of the weapon or ammunition used as a component.

		\subsection{Daylight}
3rd-level evocation \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} 60 feet \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S \\
\textbf{Duration:} 1 hour \\
A 60-foot-radius sphere of light spreads out from a point you choose within range. The sphere is bright light and sheds dim light for an additional 60 feet. \\
If you chose a point on an object you are holding or one that isn’t being worn or carried, the light shines from the object and moves with it. Completely covering the affected object with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the light. \\
If any of this spell’s area overlaps with an area of darkness created by a spell of 3rd level or lower, the spell that created the darkness is dispelled.

		\subsection{Lightning Arrow}
3rd-level transmutation \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 bonus action \\
\textbf{Range:} Self \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S \\
\textbf{Duration:} Concentration, up to 1 minute \\
The next time you make a ranged weapon attack during the spell’s duration, the weapon’s ammunition, or the weapon itself if it’s a thrown weapon, transforms into a bolt of lightning. Make the attack roll as normal. The target takes 4d8 lightning damage on a hit, or half as much damage on a miss, instead of the weapon’s normal damage. \\
Whether you hit or miss, each creature within 10 feet of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. Each of these creatures takes 2d8 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The piece of ammunition or weapon then returns to its normal form. \\
\textbf{At Higher Levels:} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage for both effects of the spell increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.

		\subsection{Nondetection}
3rd-level abjuration \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} Touch \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S, M (a pinch of diamond dust worth 25 gp sprinkled over the target, wich the spell consumes) \\
\textbf{Duration:} 8 hours \\

		\subsection{Plant Growth}
3rd-level transmutation \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action or 8 hours \\
\textbf{Range:} 150 feet \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S \\
\textbf{Duration:} Instantaneous \\
This spell channels vitality into plants within a specific area. There are two possible uses for the spell, granting either immediate or long-term benefits. \\
If you cast this spell using 1 action, choose a point within range. All normal plants in a 100-foot radius centered on that point become thick and overgrown. A creature moving through the area must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves. \\
You can exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell’s area from being affected. \\
If you cast this spell over 8 hours, you enrich the land. All plants in a half-mile radius centered on a point within range become enriched for 1 year. The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested.

		\subsection{Protection from Energy}
3rd-level abjuration \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} Touch \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S \\

		\subsection{Speak with Plants}
3rd-level transmutation \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} Self (30-foot radius) \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S \\
\textbf{Duration:} 10 minutes \\
You imbue plants within 30 feet of you with limited sentience and animation, giving them the ability to communicate with you and follow your simple commands. You can question plants about events in the spell’s area within the past day, gaining information about creatures that have passed, weather, and other circumstances. \\
You can also turn difficult terrain caused by plant growth (such as thickets and undergrowth) into ordinary sterrain that lasts for the duration. Or you can turn ordinary terrain where plants are present into difficult terrain that lasts for the duration, causing vines and branches to hinder pursuers, for example. \\
Plants might be able to perform other tasks on your behalf, at the DM ’s discretion. The spell doesn’t enable plants to uproot themselves and move about, but they can freely move branches, tendrils, and stalks. \\
If a plant creature is in the area, you can communicate with it as if you shared a common language, but you gain no magical ability to influence it. \\
This spell can cause the plants created by the entangle spell to release a restrained creature.

		\subsection{Water Breathing}
3rd-level transmutation (ritual) \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\

\textbf{Components:} V, S, M (a short reed or piece of straw) \\

\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} 30 feet \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S, M (a piece of cork) \\
\textbf{Duration:} 1 hours \\
This spell grants the ability to move across any liquid surface - such as water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand, or lava - as if it were harmless solid ground (creatures crossing molten lava can still take damage from the heat). Up to ten willing creatures you can see within range gain this ability for the duration. \\
If you target a creature submerged in a liquid, the spell carries the target to the surface of the liquid at a rate of 60 feet per round.

		\subsection{Wind Wall}
3rd-level evocation \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} 120 feet \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S, M (a tiny fan and a feather of exotic origin) \\

A wall of strong wind rises from the ground at a point you choose within range. You can make the wall up to 50 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. You can shape the wall in any way you choose so long as it makes one continuous path along the ground. The wall lasts for the duration. \\
When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Strength saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. \\
The strong wind keeps fog, smoke, and other gases at bay. Small or smaller flying creatures or objects can’t pass through the wall. Loose, lightweight materials brought into the wall fly upward. Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles launched at targets behind the wall are deflected upward and automatically miss. (Boulders hurled by giants or siege engines, and similar projectiles, are unaffected.) Creatures in gaseous form can’t pass through it.

They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions. \\
The DM has the creatures’ statistics. \\
\textbf{At Higher Levels:} When you cast this spell using certain higher-level spell slots, you choose one of the summoning options above, and more creatures appear: twice as many with a 6th-level slot and three times as many with an 8th-level slot.

		\subsection{Freedom of Movement}
4th-level abjuration \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} Touch \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S, M (a leather strap, bound around the arm or a similar appendage) \\
\textbf{Duration:} 1 hour \\
You touch a willing creature. For the duration, the target’s movement is unaffected by difficult terrain, and spells and other magical effects can neither reduce the target’s speed nor cause the target to be paralyzed or restrained. \\
The target can also spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape from nonmagical restraints, such as manacles or a creature that has it grappled. Finally, being underwater imposes no penalties on the target's movement or attacks.

		\subsection{Grasping Vine}
4th-level conjuration \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 bonus action \\
\textbf{Range:} 30 feet \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S \\
\textbf{Duration:} Concentration, up to 1 minute \\
You conjure a vine that sprouts from the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. When you cast this spell, you can direct the vine to lash out at a creature within 30 feet of it that you can see. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be pulled 20 feet directly toward the vine. \\
Until the spell ends, you can direct the vine to lash out at the same creature or another one as a bonus action on each of your turns.

		\subsection{Locate Creature}
4th-level divination \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} Self \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S, M (a bit of fur from a bloodhound) \\
\textbf{Duration:} Concentration, up to 1 hour \\
Describe or name a creature that is familiar to you. You sense the direction to the creature’s location, as long as that creature is within 1,000 feet of you. If the creature is moving, you know the direction of its movement. \\
The spell can locate a specific creature known to you, or the nearest creature of a specific kind (such as a human or a unicorn), so long as you have seen such a creature up close—within 30 feet—at least once. If the creature you described or named is in a different form, such as being under the effects of a polymorph spell, this spell doesn’t locate the creature. \\
This spell can’t locate a creature if running water at least 10 feet wide blocks a direct path between you and the creature.

		\subsection{Stoneskin}
4th-level abjuration \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} Touch \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S, M (diamond dust worth 100 gp, which the spell consumes) \\
\textbf{Duration:} Concentration, up to 1 hour \\
This spell turns the flesh of a willing creature you touch as hard as stone. Until the spell ends, the target has resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.



	\section{5th Level Spells}
		\subsection{Commune with Nature}
5th-level divination (ritual) \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 minute \\
\textbf{Range:} Self \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S \\
\textbf{Duration:} Instantaneous \\
You briefly become one with nature and gain knowledge of the surrounding territory. In the outdoors, the spell gives you knowledge of the land within 3 miles of you. In caves and other natural underground settings, the radius is limited to 300 feet. The spell doesn’t function where nature has been replaced by construction, such as in dungeons and towns. \\
You instantly gain knowledge of up to three facts of your choice about any of the following subjects as they relate to the area: \\
\indent $\bullet$ terrain and bodies of water \\
\indent $\bullet$ prevalent plants, minerals, animals, or peoples \\
\indent $\bullet$ powerful celestials, fey, fiends, elementals, or undead \\
\indent $\bullet$ influence from other planes of existence \\
\indent $\bullet$ buildings \\
For example, you could determine the location of powerful undead in the area, the location of major sources of safe drinking water, and the location of any nearby towns.

		\subsection{Conjure Volley}
5th-level conjuration \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} 150 feet \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S, M (one piece of ammunition or one thrown weapon) \\
\textbf{Duration:} Instantaneous \\
You fire a piece of nonmagical ammunition from a ranged weapon or throw a nonmagical weapon into the air and choose a point within range. Hundreds of duplicates of the ammunition or weapon fall in a volley from above and then disappear. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius. 20-foot-high cylinder centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 8d8 damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The damage type is the same as that of the ammunition or weapon.

		\subsection{Swift Quiver}
5th-level transmutation \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 bonus action \\
\textbf{Range:} Touch \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S, M (a quiver containing at least one piece of ammunition) \\
\textbf{Duration:} Concentration, up to 1 minute \\
You transmute your quiver so it produces an endless supply of nonmagical ammunition, which seems to leap into your hand when you reach for it. On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action to make two attacks with a weapon that uses ammunition from the quiver. Each time you make such a ranged attack, your quiver magically replaces the piece of ammunition you used with a similar piece of nonmagical ammunition. Any pieces of ammunition created by this spell disintegrate when the spell ends. If the quiver leaves your possession, the spell ends.

		\subsection{Tree Stride}
5th-level conjuration \\
\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 action \\
\textbf{Range:} Self \\
\textbf{Components:} V, S \\
\textbf{Duration:} Concentration, up to 1 minute \\
You gain the ability to enter a tree and move from inside it to inside another tree of the same kind within 500 feet. Both trees must be living and at least the same size as you. You must use 5 feet of movement to enter a tree. You instantly know the location of all other trees of the same kind within 500 feet and, as part of the move used to enter the tree, can either pass into one of those trees or step out of the tree you’re in. You appear in a spot of your choice within 5 feet of the destination tree, using another 5 feet of movement. If you have no movement left, you appear within 5 feet of the tree you entered. \\
You can use this transportation ability once per round for the duration. You must end each turn outside a tree.
